    <h1>Avatar (2009)</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Avatar</strong> (2009) is a groundbreaking science fiction film written and directed by James Cameron.
      Set in the mid-22nd century, the story unfolds on Pandora—a lush, habitable moon orbiting a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri system.

      The film follows Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington), a paraplegic former Marine who joins the Avatar Program—
      which allows humans to control genetically engineered Na'vi bodies remotely. Jake is sent to help a human corporation mine for the
      precious mineral "unobtanium", but his growing bond with the native Na'vi—especially Neytiri (Zoe Saldana)—causes him to question
      his mission and loyalty.

      Visually, Avatar was a massive leap forward in 3D and motion capture technology. Much of the stunning world-building and visual magic
      came from the incredible work of Weta Digital. The film became a cultural phenomenon and was praised for its ambition, environmental themes,
      and immersive experience.

      Avatar grossed over $2.9 billion globally, making it the highest-grossing film of all time for several years. It won three Academy Awards
      and was nominated for nine, including Best Picture and Best Director.

    <h2>Reviews</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Avatar</em> received wide acclaim for its stunning visual effects, technological innovation, and immersive storytelling.
      While some critics noted its familiar narrative arc, most were swept away by the sheer spectacle of the film and its
      powerful message about environmentalism, colonialism, and connection to nature.
