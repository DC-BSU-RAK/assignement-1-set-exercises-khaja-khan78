  <h1>Description</h1>

  <!-- Paragraph with a description of the recipe -->
  <p>
    Biryani is a rich and aromatic rice dish that hails from the Indian subcontinent, beloved for its bold flavors, colorful presentation, and satisfying layers. Made with fragrant basmati rice, tender meat (like chicken, mutton, or beef), or sometimes vegetables, it's infused with a blend of warm spices like saffron, cardamom, and cloves. Cooked with love and often slow-cooked in a sealed pot (known as dum), biryani is more than just food—it's a celebration on a plate. Whether served at a festive gathering or enjoyed as a hearty meal, biryani is always a dish that brings people together.
